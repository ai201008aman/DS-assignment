    "1. How do word embeddings capture semantic meaning in text preprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words in a high-dimensional vector space. They are used in text preprocessing to capture semantic meaning by representing words in a way that reflects their contextual relationships and semantic similarity. By capturing semantic meaning in a dense vector space, word embeddings provide a way to represent words in a manner that facilitates various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more. They enable NLP models to understand and leverage semantic relationships between words, improving their performance on a wide range of language-related tasks."

    "Ans: The self-attention mechanism, also known as the transformer model, is a powerful technique for capturing dependencies between words in a text. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that process words in a sequential manner, the self-attention mechanism allows each word to attend to all other words in the text simultaneously. This enables the model to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. By allowing each word to attend to other words in the text, the self-attention mechanism captures both local and global dependencies. Words can assign higher attention weights to relevant words and lower weights to irrelevant or distant words, capturing fine-grained relationships between words. The self-attention mechanism has proven highly effective in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and language modeling, enabling models to capture long-range dependencies and improve the quality of generated sequences."
