    "\n",
    "Ans: Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of a model. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing the noise or irrelevant patterns, which leads to poor performance on unseen data. Regularization helps to address this issue by adding a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging the model to have simpler and more generalizable representations."

    "78. What is stacking in ensemble learning and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Stacking, also known as stacked generalization, is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple models, called base models or learners, to create a final meta-model. It goes beyond traditional ensembles by training the meta-model to make predictions based on the outputs of the base models. Stacking leverages the strengths of different models and aims to improve the overall predictive performance.\n",
