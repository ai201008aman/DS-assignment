    "1. What is the difference between a neuron and a neural network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The key difference between a neuron and a neural network lies in their scope and complexity. A neuron is an individual computational unit that performs a simple computation and produces an output. It takes inputs, applies weights, performs a sum, and applies an activation function. On the other hand, a neural network is a network structure that comprises multiple interconnected neurons organized in layers. It consists of a larger architecture that enables the network to learn and make complex computations by propagating information through the interconnected neurons."

    "\n",
    "Ans: The choice between traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning depends on various factors, including the problem domain, available data, computational resources, interpretability requirements, and desired performance. Traditional machine learning algorithms may be more suitable for smaller datasets, interpretability needs, and domains where feature engineering plays a critical role. On the other hand, deep learning shines in tasks involving large datasets, unstructured data, complex patterns, and applications that prioritize performance over interpretability."

    "\n",
    "Ans: Ensemble learning is a technique in which multiple individual models, known as base models or weak learners, are combined to make predictions or decisions. The concept of ensemble learning can also be applied in the context of neural networks, where multiple neural networks are trained and combined to form an ensemble model.    \n",
    "Ensemble learning in neural networks is particularly useful when dealing with complex and challenging tasks, large datasets, or situations where individual models may have limitations. It can improve model performance, generalization, and robustness by harnessing the collective intelligence of multiple models. However, it's important to carefully select and train diverse models and properly combine their predictions to achieve the best results."

    "Ans: The trade-off between model complexity and generalization performance is a fundamental consideration in machine learning, including neural networks. It refers to the balance between the capacity of a model to capture complex patterns in the training data (model complexity) and its ability to generalize well to unseen data. The trade-off between model complexity and generalization performance is a key consideration in neural networks. A balance must be struck to avoid underfitting and overfitting, and regularization techniques can help manage this trade-off. Finding the optimal model complexity requires careful evaluation and selection based on the available data and the desired performance on unseen data."
